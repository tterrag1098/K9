- Rework !ctrl and add configuration values for the new trick functions, see !help
- Remove footerText and footerIcon from clojure scope, tricks can no longer set the embed footer to avoid spoofing of official notice.
- Add "official" flag for tricks, to denote that it is an official server command. This will append a footer to the command output.
- Add mapping conversion! Use -c on any mappings command (see !help)
- Mapping output no longer uses embeds to be able to show more at once
